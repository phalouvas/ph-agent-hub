# Design Decisions — PH Agent Hub

A log of key design decisions made during the design phase, with rationale. Ordered chronologically. Each entry links to the doc where the decision is implemented.

## D-01 — Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) as the agent runtime

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** Use the Microsoft Agent Framework (Python, `pip install agent-framework`) as the agent execution runtime.
**Rationale:** Production-grade, open source (MIT), supports multi-agent workflows, graph-based orchestration, middleware, streaming, and OpenTelemetry out of the box. Supports migration from AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. Active community (10k+ stars, 139 contributors).
**Alternatives considered:** AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, custom agent loop.

## D-02 — SSE over WebSocket for streaming

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming agent responses to the frontend. WebSocket is not used.
**Rationale:** Chat streaming is unidirectional (server → client). SSE is designed for this. Works through nginx without special proxy configuration. Easier to debug and test than WebSocket. Stop-generation is handled by a separate `DELETE` HTTP request.
**Alternatives considered:** WebSocket (bidirectional, adds proxy complexity with no benefit for this workload).

## D-03 — sse-starlette (backend) and @microsoft/fetch-event-source (frontend)

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** Use `sse-starlette` for SSE responses in FastAPI and `@microsoft/fetch-event-source` for SSE consumption in React.
**Rationale:** `sse-starlette` is the standard SSE library for Starlette/FastAPI with minimal boilerplate. `@microsoft/fetch-event-source` is required (over native `EventSource`) because it supports SSE over POST requests — necessary since the message is sent in the request body. The native `EventSource` API only supports GET.
**Alternatives considered:** Native browser `EventSource` (does not support POST).

## D-04 — MinIO for file upload object storage

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** Use MinIO (self-hosted, S3-compatible) as the object storage backend for file uploads.
**Rationale:** S3-compatible API from day one means migrating to AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 in the future requires only changing env vars, not code. Works for single-server and multi-server deployments. Supports presigned URLs. Runs as a Docker container inside the existing stack. Local disk was rejected because it breaks multi-container deployments and has no presigned URL support.
**Alternatives considered:** Local disk (rejected — not multi-container safe, no migration path to cloud without code rewrite), AWS S3/Cloudflare R2 (premature for a self-hosted system), Ceph (too heavy).
**Reference:** [file-upload-architecture.md](../file-upload-architecture.md)

## D-05 — Single storage module rule (boto3 calls only in s3.py)

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** All MinIO/boto3 interactions are contained in `/backend/src/storage/s3.py`. No service, agent, or API handler calls `boto3` directly.
**Rationale:** Ensures future migration to AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Azure Blob Storage requires changes in exactly one file. Azure Blob Storage is not S3-compatible, so a storage abstraction layer may be needed in the future — keeping calls in one module makes that refactor straightforward.
**Alternatives considered:** Full storage abstraction interface now (deferred — not needed until a second backend is required).

## D-06 — Fernet/AES-128-CBC for API key encryption

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** Use application-level Fernet symmetric encryption (from the Python `cryptography` library) for sensitive DB fields: `models.api_key`, `erpnext_instances.api_key`, `erpnext_instances.api_secret`.
**Rationale:** Simple, no extra infrastructure, well-understood. The encryption key lives in an env var (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`). For a self-hosted platform where physical server access already implies full compromise, this threat model is appropriate. All encrypt/decrypt calls are in one module (`encryption.py`), making it replaceable with Vault or Azure Key Vault later without changing service code.
**Alternatives considered:** DB-level encryption (same single-server trust problem), HashiCorp Vault (adds operational complexity, overkill for this threat model).

## D-07 — No permissions field in JWT; role-only claims

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** The JWT payload contains only `sub` (user_id), `tenant_id`, `role`, `exp`, and `iat`. There is no `permissions` array.
**Rationale:** The three roles (`admin`, `manager`, `user`) are rigid and fully defined — a manager always has exactly the same capabilities as every other manager. A permissions array would be redundant and creates a split-brain risk: if the token's claims diverge from DB state (e.g. a role change before token expiry), the backend would enforce stale permissions. All access decisions are derived from `role` at request time via a FastAPI dependency.
**Alternatives considered:** Fine-grained permissions array in JWT (rejected — nothing to express that role doesn't already cover; introduces staleness risk).

## D-08 — Refresh token as httpOnly cookie with Redis jti denylist

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** Refresh tokens are issued as `httpOnly` cookies. Logout invalidates the token via a Redis denylist keyed by `jti` claim. Access tokens are stored in memory (not localStorage).
**Rationale:** `httpOnly` cookies are not accessible to JavaScript, eliminating XSS token theft. Redis denylist enables immediate server-side invalidation on logout. Memory-only access tokens mean no persistent token survives a browser close.
**Alternatives considered:** localStorage (vulnerable to XSS), stateless JWT-only logout (cannot revoke before expiry).
**Reference:** [backend-architecture.md](../backend-architecture.md) §7

## D-09 — Append-only audit log; no delete endpoint

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** The `audit_logs` table is append-only. No API endpoint exposes a delete operation on audit records. Retention purge is handled by a scheduled background job only.
**Rationale:** Audit logs that can be deleted are not audit logs. Admin-triggered deletion would undermine the forensic value of the log. A scheduled purge with a configurable retention period satisfies storage concerns without exposing a delete API.
**Reference:** [data-model.md](../data-model.md) §6.2

## D-10 — MariaDB full-text indexes for chat search (no dedicated search engine)

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Decision:** Full-text search across sessions and messages is implemented via MariaDB full-text indexes on `sessions.title` and text parts within `messages.content`. No dedicated search engine (Elasticsearch, Meilisearch) is introduced.
**Rationale:** Search is scoped to a single user's own data within their tenant — the result set is small. MariaDB full-text search is sufficient for this scope and avoids adding another service to the stack. A dedicated search engine can be introduced later if requirements grow.
**Alternatives considered:** Meilisearch, Elasticsearch (deferred — not justified by scope).
