# PH Agent Hub — Architecture Overview

PH Agent Hub is a modular, multi-tenant AI platform designed to provide a stable, extensible environment for agent-driven applications. The system is structured as a monorepo containing two core applications:

- **Backend (Agent Framework Server)**
- **Frontend (React Web App)**

The frontend is a single React application with two protected product areas:

- **Chat Area** for end users
- **Admin Area** for administrators

The platform is fully containerized using Docker and includes supporting services such as MariaDB and Redis.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

PH Agent Hub is built around a clean separation of responsibilities:

### **1.1 Backend (Agent Framework Server)**
The backend is the core of the platform. It provides:

- Agent execution using the [Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)](agent-framework-integration.md) — Python, `pip install agent-framework`
- Multi-model orchestration (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Tool calling and workflow coordination
- DeepSeek-compatible stabilization layer (JSON repair, retry logic, output filtering)
- Multi-tenant routing
- User authentication and authorization (JWT)
- Session and message storage
- Memory and RAG
- ERPNext and external system integrations (via tools)
- REST and streaming APIs consumed by the frontend

The backend is fully patchable and extensible, allowing custom model adapters, tool runners, and agent behaviors.

### **1.2 Frontend (React Web App)**
The frontend is a single deployable React application that shares:

- authentication and token refresh logic
- API client and request handling
- tenant context and capability loading
- design system and shared components
- route guards and role-based navigation

The frontend does **not** run agents directly. It acts as a thin client over the backend and the MAF runtime.

## 2. Chat Area

The chat area is the end-user experience inside the frontend web app. It provides:

- chat sessions and history (permanent or temporary mode)
- session pinning and title editing
- model selection
- template, prompt, and skill selection
- personal skill creation and management
- file uploads
- memory management (view, delete, manually add entries)
- session-level tool activation from tenant-approved tools
- message editing, deletion, and regeneration via non-destructive branching
- message feedback (thumbs up / down)
- full-text search across sessions and messages
- authentication via backend-issued JWT
- real-time streaming responses and agent events

The chat area contains no administrative logic.

---

## 3. Admin Area

The admin area is the operational control surface inside the same frontend web app. It is role-aware and serves two roles:

**Administrators (admin)** have full platform-wide access:
- user and tenant management
- model configuration
- tool configuration
- template and skill management
- usage analytics and logs
- system configuration

**Managers (manager)** have tenant-scoped access:
- manage users within their tenant
- create, edit, and delete tools within their tenant
- enable/disable models for their tenant
- manage templates and skills within their tenant
- view tenant-level analytics

This area is role-protected and communicates exclusively with the backend API. The backend enforces all scope boundaries.

---

## 4. Monorepo Structure

The repository is organized as:

```
/backend
/frontend
/infrastructure
/docs
```

Each application has its own Dockerfile and is orchestrated via `docker compose`.

---

## 5. Deployment Architecture

PH Agent Hub is deployed as a set of Docker services:

- **backend** — Agent Framework server
- **frontend** — single React web app containing chat and admin areas
- **mariadb** — primary relational database
- **redis** — caching, queues, memory store
- **optional vector DB** — for RAG
- **nginx** — reverse proxy

This structure supports both single-server and multi-server deployments.

---

## 6. Multi-Tenant Design

The backend supports multiple tenants, each with:

- isolated users (with roles: admin, manager, user)
- isolated models
- isolated tools
- isolated ERPNext instances (optional)
- isolated templates, prompts, and skills
- isolated sessions and memory

Tenants are enforced at the backend level using JWT claims and backend authorization rules. Managers operate within a single tenant boundary and cannot access or affect other tenants.

---

## 7. Extensibility and Monkey-Patching

PH Agent Hub is designed to allow:

- custom model adapters
- DeepSeek stabilization patches
- custom tool runners
- custom agent behaviors
- custom routing logic

This ensures compatibility with evolving LLM behaviors and enterprise integrations.

---

## 8. Goals of the Platform

PH Agent Hub aims to provide:

- a stable alternative to monolithic chat systems
- a clean architecture for agent-driven workflows
- a flexible backend for multi-model orchestration
- a scalable foundation for enterprise AI applications
- a modular system that can be extended without breaking core functionality
