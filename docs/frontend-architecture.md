# Frontend Architecture — PH Agent Hub

The frontend of PH Agent Hub is a single React web application that exposes two protected product areas:

- **Chat Area** for end users
- **Admin Area** for administrators

This document defines the shared frontend architecture that sits above both areas.

---

## 1. Frontend Role in the System

The frontend is a thin client over the backend and the Microsoft Agent Framework runtime.

The frontend is responsible for:

- authentication and token refresh UX
- route protection and role-aware navigation
- rendering chat conversations and streamed agent output
- rendering administrative resources and CRUD screens
- file upload UX
- prompt, template, skill, and configuration selection UIs

The frontend is **not** responsible for:

- running agents or workflows
- executing tools
- enforcing authorization rules
- storing authoritative conversation or configuration state

Those responsibilities remain in the backend.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

### **2.1 One App, Two Areas**
- One React codebase
- One deployable frontend service
- Separate route domains, layouts, and feature modules for chat and admin

### **2.2 Backend-Authoritative Behavior**
- The backend owns sessions, prompts, templates, skills, tools, permissions, and agent execution
- Frontend role checks are for UX only; backend authorization is authoritative

### **2.3 Shared Foundation**
- Shared authentication provider
- Shared API client
- Shared design system and UI primitives
- Shared query, mutation, and error handling patterns

### **2.4 Controlled Specialization**
- Chat area uses fully custom React components
- Admin area may use Refine Core where it accelerates CRUD-heavy screens
- Analytics, logs, and agent-specific operational views remain custom when needed

---

## 3. Technology Stack

Recommended stack:

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **React Router**
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching and mutations
- **SSE or WebSockets** for streaming responses and agent events
- **TailwindCSS, Material UI, or another shared design system**
- **Refine Core** for the admin area only

The frontend should remain framework-light and avoid duplicating backend behavior.

## 4. High-Level Architecture

## 5. Route Structure

Suggested route domains:

```
/
/login
/chat
/chat/:sessionId
/admin
/admin/users
/admin/tenants
/admin/models
/admin/tools
/admin/templates
/admin/skills
/admin/analytics
/admin/settings
```

Admin routes under `/admin/tenants` and `/admin/settings` are visible to `admin` only. All other `/admin` routes are accessible to both `admin` and `manager`, with the backend enforcing tenant scope for managers.

---

## 6. Shared Frontend Modules

Suggested structure:

```
/frontend
  /src
    /app
      App.tsx
      router.tsx
    /providers
      AuthProvider.tsx
      QueryProvider.tsx
      TenantProvider.tsx
    /services
      api.ts
      auth.ts
    /shared
      /components
      /layouts
      /theme
      /utils
    /features
      /chat
      /admin
```

The chat and admin areas should share foundations, but not implementation details that make the code harder to reason about.

---

## 7. Authentication and Access Control

- JWT is stored in memory, not localStorage
- Initial app bootstrap loads authenticated user, role, and tenant context
- Three roles carried in JWT: `admin`, `manager`, `user`
- Route guards:
  - `user` role → chat area only
  - `manager` role → chat area + admin area (tenant-scoped)
  - `admin` role → full access to chat and admin areas
- Backend enforces all authorization rules on every protected endpoint

This keeps the frontend simple while preserving a strong security model.

---

## 8. Data Access and Streaming

### **8.1 Standard Resource Access**
- REST API for users, tenants, models, tools, templates, prompts, skills, logs, and settings
- Shared data layer for query caching, loading states, and mutation flows

### **8.2 Agent Interaction**
- Streaming responses are delivered from the backend to the chat area
- The frontend renders tokens, tool activity, progress states, and final results
- Agent sessions remain backend-owned and are rehydrated through backend APIs

---

## 9. Refine Usage

Refine should be used only inside the admin area for screens that are primarily:

- resource lists
- CRUD forms
- filters and tables
- audit and management views

Refine should not define the architecture of the chat area.

---

## 10. Mobile Support and Progressive Web App (PWA)

The frontend is designed to be mobile-friendly and installable as a PWA on Android and iOS devices.

### **10.1 Responsive Design**
- All chat area layouts must be responsive and usable on small screens
- TailwindCSS responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) are the primary tool for adaptive layouts
- The admin area should be functional on tablet and above; full mobile optimization is secondary for admin screens

### **10.2 PWA Requirements**
The frontend must ship as a valid PWA. The required artifacts are:

- **`manifest.json`** — declares app name, short name, icons (192×192 and 512×512 PNG), theme color, background color, and `display: "standalone"`
- **Service Worker** — handles asset caching and enables offline shell loading; use `vite-plugin-pwa` (Workbox-based) to generate this automatically
- **HTTPS** — required for PWA installation and already mandatory for JWT authentication

### **10.3 Installation Behavior**

| Platform | Browser | Install mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Android | Chrome | Automatic install prompt when manifest + service worker are detected |
| iOS | Safari | Manual: user taps Share → "Add to Home Screen" |
| Desktop | Chrome / Edge | Install button appears in the address bar |

On Android, Chrome automatically shows an install prompt. On iOS, installation is manual through Safari's Share menu — this is an OS-level constraint and cannot be changed.

### **10.4 PWA Scope**
The PWA install targets the **Chat Area** as the primary experience. The admin area is accessible once installed but is not the primary mobile use case.

### **10.5 Implementation Notes**
- Use `vite-plugin-pwa` to generate the service worker and manifest during the build
- Cache the app shell (HTML, JS, CSS) for fast load on repeat visits
- Do not cache backend API responses in the service worker; data freshness is handled by TanStack Query
- Push notifications (for agent completion events) are supported on Android and on iOS 16.4+

## 11. Goals of the Frontend Architecture

- keep the frontend thin and backend-driven
- avoid maintaining two separate frontend applications
- share authentication, routing, and UI foundations
- preserve strong separation between chat and admin experiences
- support future prompt, skill, and agent UX without re-architecting the app
- deliver a mobile-friendly, installable experience through PWA support
