# Backend Architecture — PH Agent Hub

The backend of PH Agent Hub is the core service responsible for agent execution, model orchestration, tool integration, authentication, multi-tenant routing, and all persistent data operations. It exposes the APIs and streaming interfaces consumed by the single React frontend, which contains separate chat and admin areas.

This document defines the backend's responsibilities, internal structure, and integration points.

---

## 1. Backend Responsibilities

The backend provides the following core capabilities:

### **1.1 Agent Execution**
- Runs agent loops using the [Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)](agent-framework-integration.md) — Python package `agent-framework`
- Agents are assembled per request from tenant and session state (model, template, skill, active tools)
- Supports multi‑step reasoning and tool calling via MAF's `Agent` and `Workflow` primitives
- Provides a DeepSeek‑compatible stabilization layer implemented as MAF middleware (JSON repair, retries, output filtering)
- Supports streaming responses and agent events to the chat area via SSE

### **1.2 Model Orchestration**
- Supports multiple model providers (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)
- Allows per‑tenant model configuration
- Allows administrators to enable/disable models
- Provides routing logic for selecting the correct model per request

### **1.3 Tool Execution**
- ERPNext API tools (per‑tenant)
- Membrane tools
- Custom tools (Python modules)
- Tool permission enforcement based on user roles and tenant settings
- Session-level tool activation: users may activate tenant-approved tools per session; the active tool list is enforced at execution time
- Managers may create, edit, and delete tools within their tenant

### **1.4 Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT‑based authentication
- Three user roles:
  - **admin** — platform-wide access; manages all tenants and platform configuration
  - **manager** — tenant-scoped operator; can manage tools, models, templates, skills, and users within their own tenant
  - **user** — end user; chat area access only
- Tenant isolation enforced on every request
- Per‑tenant model and tool access rules
- Role claims in JWT used for endpoint-level permission enforcement

### **1.5 Data Storage**
- Users, roles, tenants
- Models and tool configurations
- Templates, user prompts, and skills (tenant-shared and user-owned)
- Permanent chat sessions and messages (MariaDB)
- Temporary chat sessions (Redis with TTL; purged on logout or expiry)
- Message branches, soft-deleted messages, and message feedback
- Session-level active tool associations
- Memory items (per user, optionally per session; supports manual user entries)
- RAG documents
- ERPNext instance configurations
- Schema defined as SQLAlchemy ORM models; migrations versioned and applied with Alembic

### **1.6 Multi‑Tenant Routing**
Each request is routed based on:
- JWT tenant claim
- Tenant‑specific model list
- Tenant‑specific tool list
- Tenant‑specific ERPNext instance (optional)
- Tenant‑specific templates and shared skills
- User‑owned prompts and personal skills within the tenant boundary

### **1.7 Extensibility**
The backend is designed to be fully patchable:
- Custom model adapters
- DeepSeek monkey‑patching
- Custom tool runners
- Custom agent behaviors
- Skill definitions mapped to MAF agents and workflows via `maf_target_key` (see [agent-framework-integration.md](agent-framework-integration.md))
- Middleware for request/response processing

## 5. ORM & Database Migrations

The backend uses **SQLAlchemy 2.0** as the ORM and **Alembic** for schema migrations.

### **5.1 SQLAlchemy ORM**
- All database tables are defined as SQLAlchemy model classes under `/db/orm/`
- The async session factory (`AsyncSession`) is configured in `/db/base.py` using `aiomysql` as the MariaDB driver
- Complex queries (e.g., message branching tree, full-text search) are written as raw SQL via `session.execute(text(...))` and called from the service layer
- JSON columns (`messages.content`, `messages.tool_calls`, `tools.config`, etc.) map to SQLAlchemy's `JSON` column type and are read/written as Python dicts

### **5.2 Alembic Migrations**
- Migration scripts live in `/db/migrations/versions/`
- Alembic tracks applied migrations in the `alembic_version` table it manages in MariaDB
- To generate a migration after changing a model: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`
- All generated migration files must be reviewed before applying — autogenerate does not detect changes inside JSON columns, custom check constraints, or complex index types
- To apply all pending migrations: `alembic upgrade head`

### **5.3 Migration on Startup**
- The backend container runs `alembic upgrade head` as part of its Docker entrypoint before starting the application server
- This ensures the schema is always up to date on every deployment without manual intervention
- The MariaDB container must be healthy before the backend starts; a health-check is used in `docker-compose.yml` for this purpose

---

## 6. DeepSeek Stabilization Layer

The backend includes a dedicated stabilization module responsible for:

- Stripping `<think>` reasoning tokens
- Repairing invalid JSON
- Validating tool calls
- Retrying failed model outputs
- Enforcing schema compliance
- Filtering hallucinated tool names
- Preventing infinite agent loops

This module is fully monkey‑patchable.

---

## 7. JWT Payload and Multi-Tenant Enforcement

Every protected request carries a JWT signed with `JWT_SECRET`. The payload contains:

```json
{
  "sub": "<user_id>",
  "tenant_id": "<tenant_id>",
  "role": "admin | manager | user",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234567890
}
```

**Why no `permissions` field:** The three roles are rigid and fully defined — a manager always has exactly the same capabilities as every other manager. There is nothing a `permissions` array could express that `role` does not already cover. Putting a derived permissions list in the JWT would create a split-brain risk: if the token's claims diverge from DB state (e.g. a role change before token expiry), the backend could enforce stale permissions. All access decisions are derived from `role` at request time using a single authorisation dependency injected into every protected endpoint.

### Role enforcement rules

| Claim check | Enforcement point |
|---|---|
| `role == admin` | Admin-only endpoints (tenant management, system settings) |
| `role in (admin, manager)` | Admin area endpoints; manager is additionally scoped to own `tenant_id` |
| `tenant_id` matches resource | Every data query — no cross-tenant data ever returned |
| `role == user` OR any role | Chat area endpoints |

### Token lifetime and refresh

- Access token TTL: configurable via `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (default 3600 seconds)
- Refresh token: issued alongside the access token; stored as an `httpOnly` cookie; TTL configurable via `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN` (default 7 days)
- The `/auth/refresh` endpoint validates the refresh token cookie and issues a new access token
- On logout, the refresh token is invalidated server-side via a Redis denylist keyed by `jti` claim
- Role changes (e.g. a manager being demoted) take effect at the next token refresh

### Implementation

JWT logic lives exclusively in `/backend/src/core/jwt.py`. No other module encodes or decodes tokens directly.

---

## 8. Encryption

Sensitive fields (`models.api_key`, `erpnext_instances.api_key`, `erpnext_instances.api_secret`) are encrypted at the application layer using **Fernet symmetric encryption** (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) from the Python `cryptography` library.

### How it works
- The encryption key is loaded from the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable at startup
- All encrypt/decrypt operations go through `/backend/src/core/encryption.py` — the only file that imports `cryptography`
- Values are encrypted before being written to MariaDB and decrypted after being read
- The SQLAlchemy ORM models for `models` and `erpnext_instances` use a custom `EncryptedString` column type that transparently handles encrypt/decrypt at the ORM layer, so service code never handles raw ciphertext

### Key generation
```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```
The output is a 32-byte base64url-encoded key. Store it in `.env` as `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

### Key rotation
If the encryption key must be rotated:
1. Generate a new key
2. Run the provided key-rotation migration utility: `python -m backend.src.core.encryption rotate --old-key OLD --new-key NEW`
3. Replace `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env` and redeploy

The key and the encrypted data live on the same server — this is acceptable for a self-hosted platform where physical server access already implies full compromise. For stricter requirements, the `encryption.py` module can be replaced with a Vault or Azure Key Vault adapter without changing any other code.

---

## 9. Deployment

The backend runs as a Docker container and depends on:

- MariaDB
- Redis
- MinIO
- Optional vector DB
- Nginx reverse proxy

It is designed for both single‑server and multi‑server deployments.

---

## 9. Goals of the Backend

- Provide a stable, extensible agent runtime
- Support DeepSeek and other advanced models
- Enable multi‑tenant AI applications
- Provide clean APIs for both frontend areas
- Allow safe monkey‑patching and customization
- Maintain strict separation of concerns
- Support dual-mode session persistence (permanent via MariaDB, temporary via Redis)
- Support non-destructive message branching for edits and regeneration
- Expose message feedback for model quality analytics
